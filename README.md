# TypeScript Coursework

This repository contains my coursework and projects related to learning TypeScript. Throughout this journey, I've explored various aspects of TypeScript, including its features, syntax, and best practices. 

## What I've Learned

- Basic Types: Understanding primitive types (string, number, boolean) and their usage.
- Interfaces and Types: Creating and implementing interfaces to define object shapes and using type aliases.
- Function Types: Defining function types and understanding optional and default parameters.
- Classes and Inheritance: Utilizing classes, constructors, and inheritance to create reusable code.
- Generics: Learning how to create functions and classes that work with any data type.
- Modules: Organizing code using modules, exports, and imports for better maintainability.
- Error Handling: Implementing try-catch blocks and understanding TypeScript's type checking for error handling.
- Advanced Types: Exploring union types, intersection types, and mapped types for more complex type definitions.

This repository serves as a reflection of my progress in mastering TypeScript and showcases the projects and exercises that helped solidify my understanding of this powerful language. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
